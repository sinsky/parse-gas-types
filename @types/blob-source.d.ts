interface BlobSource {
  /**Return the data inside this object as a blob converted to the specified content type. This
method adds the appropriate extension to the filenameâ€”for example, "myfile.pdf". However, it
assumes that the part of the filename that follows the last period (if any) is an existing
extension that should be replaced. Consequently, "ShoppingList.12.25.2014" becomes
"ShoppingList.12.25.pdf".

To view the daily quotas for conversions, see [Quotas for Google
Services](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas). Newly created Google Workspace domains might be temporarily subject to stricter
quotas.
@param contentType The MIME type to convert to. For most blobs, `'application/pdf'` is
    the only valid option. For images in BMP, GIF, JPEG, or PNG format, any of `'image/bmp'`, `'image/gif'`, `'image/jpeg'`, or `'image/png'` are also
    valid. For a Google Docs document, `'text/markdown'` is also valid.
