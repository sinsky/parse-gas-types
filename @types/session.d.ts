identity, [`User.getEmail()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/user.html#getEmail()) returns a blank string. The circumstances in which the
email address is available vary: for example, the user's email address is not available in any
context that allows a script to run without that user's authorization, like a simple `onOpen(e)` or `onEdit(e)` trigger, a custom function in Google Sheets, or a web app
deployed to "execute as me" (that is, authorized by the developer instead of the user).
However, these restrictions generally do not apply if the developer runs the script themselves
or belongs to the same Google Workspace domain as the user.
